    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this notebook, I examine a standard dynamic general-equilibrium model of a small open endowment economy with incomplete international financial markets, closelly following the frameworks of Lubik (2007) and Uribe & Schmitt-Grohé (2017).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Open-economy models usually feature an international financial asset—most commonly a one-period risk-free bond—that residents of a small country can buy or sell freely without affecting its price or the world interest rate. This feature essentially defines a “small” economy, one too small to influence international prices (McCandless, 2008). Yet, when such a risk-free asset is included in a stochastic small open economy with incomplete markets—where households only have access to this single bond and cannot diversify risk—the model becomes nonstationary, as equilibrium dynamics inherit a random-walk component.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Within this setting, the goals are: (i) to analytically solve the model’s linearized SOE system, (ii) to show that the unconditional variances of debt, the trade balance, and consumption are not finite (they diverge in the long run), and (iii) to build Dynare code capable of numerically simulating the economy’s response in steady state to a temporary stochastic endowment disturbance—considering two cases: Case 01 with i.i.d. endowment shocks and Case 02 with an AR(1) endowment process.</p>\n"

    "## Model Assumptions \n",
    "* <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The economy is inhabited by a continuum of identical households. They have the same preferences, receive the same stochastic endowment, face the same international interest rate, and are subject to the same budget constraint and uncertainty. Since all households are identical, their aggregate decisions are simply the decisions of any single household multiplied by the measure of the population. Therefore, it is possible to study only one of them and refer to it as the representative household.</p> \n",
    "* <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In each period, the representative household receives an exogenous but stochastic endowment of perishable goods—that is, goods that are non-accumulable and non-storable (there is no capital accumulation), and can only be consumed within the same period. This endowment does not depend on capital or labor inputs. Hence, in this economy, there is no production activity and no decisions regarding factor inputs; the household simply takes as given that amount of goods available each period. Since there is no capital accumulation and only a single consumption good, one unit of the consumption good corresponds to one unit of real income.</p> \n",
    "* <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Households have access to an internationally traded risk-free bond, which they use to borrow or lend so as to smooth consumption over time in response to stochastic endowment (income) shocks. Since income is measured in units of the consumption good, consumption smoothing naturally induces equilibrium fluctuations in the trade balance and the current account.</p> \n",
    "* <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The preferences of the representative household, $𝑈$, that is, the expected value of the sum of the current utility and future utility flows discounted to the current period, are given by:</p> \n",
    "$$ U=E_0\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}{\\beta^tu\\left(c_t\\right)}; 𝛽∈(0,1) \\tag{1}$$ \n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Where $𝐸_𝑡 (∙)$ are the mathematical expectations conditioned on the information available in period $𝑡$, and $\\beta$ is the subjective (constant) intertemporal discount factor. The utility $𝑢(c_𝑡)$ of the representative household depends on the consumption $c_𝑡$ in period $𝑡$, is time-separable, twice continuously differentiable, strictly increasing $u'(c_t)>0$, strictly concave $u''(c_t)<0$, and satisfies the following conditions:</p> \\begin{equation} \\lim_{c_t \\to 0} u'(c_t) = +\\infty, \\qquad \\lim_{c_t \\to \\infty} u'(c_t) = 0. \\tag{Inada conditions} \\end{equation} \n",
    "* <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similar to Uribe & Smichtt-Grohé (2017), the budget constraint of the representative household, period by period, takes the following form:</p> \n",

Equation (2) states that, in each period 𝑡, the sum of consumption and past debt service equals the sum of exogenous endowment (the household’s available resources) and new debt.\n",
    "</p> <div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> <b>Note 01:</b> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Alternatively, if $𝑏_𝑡$ denotes net foreign assets (international bonds) at the end of period 𝑡, and I define positive debt $d_t>0$ as the case in which the representative household owes bonds to foreign countries (i.e., is in debt to the rest of the world), then $b_t=-d_t$. Therefore, as in Lubik (2007), it is possible to write equation (2) as: $c_t+b_t= y_t+R_{t-1}b_{t-1}$. This alternative formulation of equation (2) states that, in each period 𝑡, total uses of resources (consumption and accumulation of assets) equal total sources of resources (current endowment and the return on previously accumulated assets). If $b_t > 0$: the representative household owns foreign bonds (is a creditor to the rest of the world) → it receives interest at a rate $r_t$.

    "When the temporary endowment shock is i.i.d., equation (69) indicates that only a small share of the rise in $\\hat y_t$—specifically the fraction $1-\\beta$—is passed on to $\\hat c_t$. The bulk of the increase, the fraction $\\beta$, is instead saved through foreign bond holdings. Consequently, both $\\hat tb_t$ and $\\hat ca_t$ rise by $\\beta$ (as shown in equations (72) and (73)), while $\\hat d_t$ declines by the same amount (see equation (71))."

    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The figure illustrates how the economy reacts to a positive AR(1) endowment shock under the assumption that $\\hat d_{-1}=0$. Following the temporary and unexpected increase in endowment, $\\hat c_t$ jumps once and for all, though by less than the initial rise in $\\hat y_t$. Consequently, both $\\hat tb_t$ and $\\hat ca_t$ improve on impact. After this initial boost, they gradually move back toward their respective long-run values. In the new steady state, however, $\\hat tb_t$ settles below its pre-shock level. The reason is that the economy ultimately reaches a lower level of $\\hat d_t$, which requires a smaller trade surplus to service. Hence, while a positive endowment shock leads to a short-run improvement in $\\hat tb_t$, it ultimately causes a long-run decline, Uribe & Smichtt-Grohé (2017).</p>"

    "# Summary of ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the linearized canonical small-open-economy (SOE) model studied here, two configurations of the real endowment process (Cases 01 and 02) were considered. In both specifications the representative household’s budget constraint implies that the debt position $\\hat d_t$ accumulates past productivity shocks and therefore behaves as an integrated process of order one, $𝐼(1)$. Concretely, $\\hat d_t$ can be written as a deterministic function of the initial conditions plus a sum of past shocks with coefficients that contain a non-vanishing component; accordingly $Δ\\hat d_t$ is stationary while $\\hat d_t$ itself exhibits a variance that grows without bound.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a consequence, any endogenous variable that is an affine function of $\\hat d_{𝑡−1}$ in the linearized equilibrium —for example consumption $\\hat c_t$ in both Case 01 and Case 02, and the trade balance $\\hat tb_t$ in Case 02— inherits this nonstationary behaviour in levels. In contrast, variables that depend only on the endowment $\\hat y_t$ (for instance the linearized current account $\\hat ca_t$ in the two cases considered) remain stationary provided the exogenous process $\\hat y_t$ is stationary (i.e. $∣𝜌∣<1$).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Therefore, the unconditional second-order moments (long-run variances, cross-covariances and autocorrelations) of $\\hat d_t$, $\\hat c_t$ and $\\hat tb_t$ do not exist in the sense of convergence to finite constants: their variance grows without bound over time and their long-run covariances and autocorrelations are not well-defined. This feature complicates both the statistical analysis of cycles and any quantitative evaluation based on unconditional moments of the linearized model. To generate stationary dynamics and well-defined unconditional moments, the model must incorporate additional debt-stabilizing elements—such as endogenous discounting, portfolio adjustment costs, debt-elastic interest rates, or alternative external asset accumulation conditions [For further discussion, see Uribe & Schmitt-Grohé (2003, 2017)].</p> "
