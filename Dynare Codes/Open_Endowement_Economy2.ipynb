    "## Model Assumptions\n",
    "* <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The economy is inhabited by a continuum of identical households. They have the same preferences, receive the same stochastic endowment, face the same international interest rate, and are subject to the same budget constraint and uncertainty.\n",
    "Since all households are identical, their aggregate decisions are simply the decisions of any single household multiplied by the measure of the population. Therefore, it is possible to study only one of them and refer to it as the representative household.</p>\n",
    "* <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In each period, the representative household receives an exogenous but stochastic endowment of perishable goods—that is, goods that are non-accumulable and non-storable (there is no capital accumulation), and can only be consumed within the same period. This endowment does not depend on capital or labor inputs. Hence, in this economy, there is no production activity and no decisions regarding factor inputs; the household simply takes as given that amount of goods available each period.\n",
    "Since there is no capital accumulation and only a single consumption good, one unit of the consumption good corresponds to one unit of real income.</p>\n",
    "* <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Households have access to an internationally traded risk-free bond, which they use to borrow or lend so as to smooth consumption over time in response to stochastic endowment (income) shocks. Since income is measured in units of the consumption good, consumption smoothing naturally induces equilibrium fluctuations in the trade balance and the current account.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The preferences of the representative household, 𝑈, that is, the expected value of the sum of the current utility and future utility flows discounted to the current period, are given by:</p>\n",
    "$$ U=E_0\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}{\\beta^tu\\left(c_t\\right)}; 𝛽∈(0,1) \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Where $𝐸_𝑡 (∙)$ are the mathematical expectations conditioned on the information available in period 𝑡, and 𝛽 is the subjective (constant) intertemporal discount factor. The utility $𝑢(c_𝑡)$ of the representative household depends on the consumption $c_𝑡$ in period 𝑡  [with: $u'(c_t)>0$, $u''(c_t)<0$], and satisfies the following conditions:</p>\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",

    "\\tag{Inada conditions}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "* <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similar to Uribe & Smichtt-Grohé (2017), the budget constraint of the representative household, period by period, takes the following form:</p>\n",
    "$$c_t+R_{t-1}d_{t-1}= y_t+d_t\\tag{2}$$\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Where $d_t$ is the debt of the representative household at the end of period 𝑡 (at time 𝑡), which must be repaid at the beginning of period 𝑡+1 (at time 𝑡+1); $c_𝑡$ is consumption of period 𝑡, $R_t=1+r_t$ represents the international gross interest rate (the total gross return factor on debt) between periods 𝑡 and 𝑡+1, consiting of the principal (1) plus the international net interest rate at which the household can borrow or save through external bonds $r_t$; and $y_𝑡$ is the exogenous and stochastic endowment of goods (it does not depend on the stock of physical capital or labor). Equation (2) states that, in each period 𝑡, the sum of consumption and past debt service equals the sum of exogenous endowment (the household’s available resources) and new debt.</p>\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note 01:</b> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Alternatively, if $𝑏_𝑡$ denotes net foreign assets (international bonds) at the end of period \n",
    "𝑡, and I define positive debt $d_t>0$ as the case in which the representative household owes bonds to foreign countries (i.e., is in debt to the rest of the world), then $b_t=-d_t$. Therefore, as in Lubik (2007), it is possible to write equation (2) as: $c_t+b_t= y_t+R_{t-1}b_{t-1}$. This alternative formulation of equation (2) states that, in each period 𝑡, total uses of resources (consumption and accumulation of assets) equal total sources of resources (current endowment and the return on previously accumulated assets). If $b_t > 0$: the representative household owns foreign bonds\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "* <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To eliminate the possibility that the representative household could indefinitely incur debt and refinance its debt ad infinitum (i.e., participate in Ponzi schemes), it will be assumed that the representative household is subject to a natural debt limit.

Given these assumptions, a rational expectations equilibrium is defined as a sequence of processes $\\left\\{ c_t, d_t \\right\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}$ that satisfy equations (3), (9), and (12), given the initial condition $d_{−1}$ and the exogenous sequence $\\left\\{y_t \\right\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}$.</p>\n",
